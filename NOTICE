Originated from ros2_dotnet/ros2_dotnet and later co-developed in adambrw/ros2_dotnet fork by Adam Dabrowski and Samuel Lidgren.
Since then, a closed source version was developed by Robotec.ai, including major changes to almost all parts of the project, before
being released back into open source as ros2cs.
